# Developer Portfolio

Visit live site: [Austen Turner Portfolio](https://austenpturner.github.io/portfolio/)

Built with React and Sass, using Context and custom hooks for UI states and transitions.

I consider all of my projects works-in-progress - there's always something to improve upon! This is the 3rd iteration of my portfolio website and I plan to continue to develop it as I become inspired and learn new skills.

Thanks for visiting!

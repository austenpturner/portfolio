    "Hi, I’m Austen. I use responsive design to create intuitive and eye-catching websites. After completing University of Washington’s Full-Stack Development Program, I worked as a Web Developer for TitanFlow while acquiring leadership skills as Clinical Manager at SeattleNTC. I've continued to sharpen my skills by building practice projects and completing development challenges through sites like Frontend Mentor. While I have experience with CSS frameworks and WordPress, I like to build my own reusable components with custom styles using React and SCSS.",
